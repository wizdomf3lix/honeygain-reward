## Pulling Image 🐳
**64-Bit Platform:** `linux/amd64` `linux/arm64`
```sh
# Bun runtime
docker pull ghcr.io/xterna/honeygain-pot
```
```sh
# Node.js runtime
docker pull ghcr.io/xterna/honeygain-pot:node

## Overview 🐝
[**Honeygain-Pot**](https://bit.ly/3x6nX1S) 🍯 is a script (bot) powered by `Bun`/`Node.js`, `JavaScript` and Shell scripting to automatically claim your lucky pot bonus daily from [**Honeygain**](https://bit.ly/3x6nX1S)🐝.

The script is designed to be run in a docker environment, allowing it to be deployed alongside the Honeygain docker container.

It uses very minimal resources, resulting in the CPU utilisation staying at idle **0%** the entire time unless logging into the website.
```
CONTAINER ID   NAME            CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT   MEM %     NET I/O         BLOCK I/O     PIDS
33d34f74cd0e   honeygain-pot   0.20%     3.02MiB / 320MiB    0.94%     3.3MB / 206kB   0B / 43.6MB   3
```

> [**Income Generator**](https://github.com/XternA/income-generator) (IGM) comes pre-configured with this image and auto-update. A tool which consolidates and earns passive income from multiple sources. IGM utilises the faster runtime version.

## Features 🚀
- Automatically log in and claim daily lucky pot.
- Find out the remaining time before the next claim.
- Set up the timer and auto-wait for the duration.
- On ready to reclaim, repeat the cycle.
- If an error occurs, will cool down and re-attempt.
- Works with `Honeygain` and `JumpTask` mode.

## Usage 📃
Define the following environment variable to bootstrap the image.

| Variable | Description | Mandatory |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **EMAIL**     | Your Honeygain email address    | YES |
| **PASSWORD**  | Your Honeygain password         | YES |

Or supply credentials in a Dotenv `.env` file.
```markdown
EMAIL=<email_address>
PASSWORD=<password_credential>
```

## Docker Deployment 🐳
### Compose
File: `compose.yml`
```yaml
services:
  honeygain-pot:
    container_name: honeygain-pot
    image: ghcr.io/xterna/honeygain-pot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMAIL=$EMAIL
      - PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
```

With Honeygain app docker image.
```yaml
services:
  honeygain:
    container_name: honeygain
    image: honeygain/honeygain
    restart: always
    command: -tou-accept -email $EMAIL -pass $PASSWORD -device $<name_to_identify_device>
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8

  honeygain-pot:
    container_name: honeygain-pot
    image: xterna/honeygain-pot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMAIL=$EMAIL
      - PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
    depends_on:
      - honeygain
```

Execute where compose file is located.
```yaml
docker compose up -d
```

ℹ️ **Note:** If you apply resource limits such as CPU and RAM you need to set the following bare minimum:
```
  - cpu=0.8
  - mem_limit=350m
```
The script won't be able to run properly and will constantly timeout if the CPU and RAM limit is set lower than recommended. This is only required during the boot-up phase where it needs to spin up a headless browser to connect to the site. Resource is most intensive only during this phase.

### CLI
Using environment variable or Dotenv `.env` defined e.g.
```sh
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name honeygain-pot -e EMAIL=$HONEYGAIN_EMAIL -e PASSWORD=$HONEYGAIN_PASSWORD ghcr.io/xterna/honeygain-pot
```

Directly passing credentials.
```sh
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name honeygain-pot -e EMAIL=example.gmail.com -e PASSWORD=pass123 ghcr.io/xterna/honeygain-pot
```
This will start the application in the background. The alias assigned is `honeygain-pot`.
